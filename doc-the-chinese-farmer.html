<h2>The story</h2>

<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q><em>Maybe</em>.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>Oh, isn&#39;t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said,<q><em>Maybe</em>.</q></p>

<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that&#39;s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q><em>Maybe</em>.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn&#39;t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q><em>Maybe</em>.</q></p>

<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it&#39;s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> &#45; because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
